								<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
								<p>
									I am a Computer Vision and Machine Learning researcher based in Espoo, Finland. I hold a Master of Science (MSc) degree in Software and Telecommunication Technology from the University of Jyväskylä,
									and I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Machine Learning and Computer Vision at Aalto University. 
									My experience includes the development and implementation of custom detection solutions using computer vision techniques. 
									I have specialized in image and video processing, building object detection and recognition solutions, predominantly leveraging deep learning methodologies.
									In my previous role as a Solution Consultant, I actively engaged in the development of Machine Learning and DevOps solutions for diverse customer use cases at Tietoevry.
									I am dedicated to advancing my knowledge and research pursuits in my current role as a Doctoral Researcher in Content-Based Image and Information Retrieval Group at Aalto University, Department of Computer Science. 
									<br/><br/>
									My interest in science lies in researching and developing new innovative AI solutions to obtain information from images and videos.
									In my thesis I studied the sensitivity of pretrained lightweight object detection models against the adversarial noise in images.
									I chose this subject as it combined the security aspect and computer vision, which were two main study lines that I took courses during my studies. 
									Prior to my thesis I worked as a Research Assistant in Faculty of Information Technology at University of Jyväskylä in Computer Vision Project which taught me the basics of research workflow.
									In future projects I am looking to integrate computer vision into sports and environmental studies to develop innovative solutions and acquire valuable insights through this technology.
									Currently in my research I am working with Remote Sensing, Hyperspectral Imaging, Computer Vision and Deep Learning.
									<br/><br/>
									- Ville
